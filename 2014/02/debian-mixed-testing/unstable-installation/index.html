    <p>I&rsquo;ve recently decided to move away from <a href="http://www.linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</a> to
<a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>. This blog post (and one or two more) will detail
how I went about installing and configuring it.</p>
<p>This will probably be quite long and possibly quite technical, but hopefully should be
understandable if you have some basic Linux knowledge.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not interested in reading the blurb that led me to switch to Debian,
scroll down to the <strong>Initial Setup</strong> section.</p>
<h2 id="why-debian">Why Debian?</h2>
<p>A few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>I haven&rsquo;t liked the direction Ubuntu has been taking for the last few years</li>
<li>I plan to make more use of Debian for personal and work servers (versus Ubuntu)</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve got a new <a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/gb/en/laptops/thinkpad/t-series/t430/">laptop</a>
and wanted a fresh start</li>
</ol>
<p>Although point 1 isn&rsquo;t a major deciding factor for my move (more so because
I am using Linux Mint versus vanilla Ubuntu), I am keen to avoid
software that seems very Ubuntu-centric (Upstart, for example) and instead use more
widely used alternatives such as systemd.</p>
<p>In terms using Debian for servers: I haven&rsquo;t really had any issues using Ubuntu LTS,
but I don&rsquo;t feel comfortable performing dist-upgrades for those (some will insist on
performing complete re-installs, which I&rsquo;m inclined to agree with). Debian&rsquo;s method of
upgrading from oldstable to the new stable seems easier and more reliable. I haven&rsquo;t
put this into practice yet, but it&rsquo;s something to consider for non-essential servers.</p>
<p>I also had some objectives with this installation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Replicate as closely as possible the <a href="http://cinnamon.linuxmint.com/">Cinnamon</a> desktop environment, with XFCE4</li>
<li>Make use of newer packages without compromising day-to-day stability too much</li>
<li>Keep the system as &ldquo;clean&rdquo; as possible (avoiding gratuitous use of 3rd-party repos)</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been drawn to Cinnamon since I first used Linux Mint a few years ago, after
switching from Ubuntu around the time that Unity was introduced. Unfortunately,
at the time of writing, Cinnamon doesn&rsquo;t seem to work properly on Debian Wheezy
(when tested in a virtual machine), so I&rsquo;ve decided to use XFCE4 after having tried
and compared it against GNOME 3.</p>
<p>In the next post I will outline the changes I&rsquo;ve made to XFCE4 to bring it more
in-line with what I like and am used to; hopefully you might find some of these
changes useful too.</p>
<p>Regarding point 2: I&rsquo;m of the camp that prefers a stable desktop to one that&rsquo;s
constantly in flux, such as Arch. I should make it clear that I like and admire
Arch, and have tried it myself (and have it running on a Raspberry Pi currently),
but Debian is what I&rsquo;m used to, know my way around, and what I want to focus my
personal and professional life on for the near future.</p>
<p>Initially while testing, I used Debian Stable in a virtual machine but noticed that
XFCE4 was a version behind and the current version included some features that I
would require in my quest to replicate Cinnamon, hence the decision to run on
the <em>testing</em> source with <em>unstable</em> as an additional (optional) source.</p>
<p>Finally, point 3: In the past I have had the habit of using PPAs and 3rd party
repositories for various software. After a while, these start to become outdated,
unsupported or just plain removed. My intention this time around is to stay with
the official Debian repositories as much as possible, albeit with some exceptions
for things like Google Chrome.</p>
<p>So, to the actual content now that the preliminaries are covered&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="initial-setup">Initial Setup</h2>
<p>First, I perform a standard install - I <strong>do not</strong> select any desktop environment
at this stage, as I prefer to do this manually.</p>
<p>After rebooting into my new Debian system, I changed my APT sources to use the
Debian <a href="http://http.debian.net/">HTTP mirror redirector</a> instead of <em>ftp.uk.debian.org</em>
which was selected during installation. Note that you <strong>should not</strong> change the
<em>security.debian.org</em> lines to use this.</p>
<p>Next, I <code>update</code>, <code>upgrade</code>, and <code>dist-upgrade</code> with <code>apt-get</code> - I wanted to make sure
everything was up to date before switching my sources to <em>testing</em>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianUnstable#What_are_some_best_practices_for_testing.2Fsid_users.3F">suggested</a>
to install <code>apt-listbugs</code> and <code>apt-listchanges</code> when using <em>testing</em>/<em>unstable</em>,
so I <code>apt-get install</code> those.</p>
<p>Now&rsquo;s the time to change to <em>testing</em> and <em>unstable</em> - to do this, I changed
all references to <em>wheezy</em> in <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> to <em>testing</em> and removed
the <em>wheezy-updates</em> lines. I also appended <code>contrib non-free</code> to each line, to
enable the other repositories.</p>
<p>I then added the <em>unstable</em> sources to the file so that I&rsquo;m able to install
packages from there if the <em>testing</em> version is broken or otherwise unsuitable.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> file for comparison:</p>
<pre><code>deb http://http.debian.net/debian/ testing main contrib non-free
deb-src http://http.debian.net/debian/ testing main contrib non-free

deb http://http.debian.net/debian/ unstable main contrib non-free
deb-src http://http.debian.net/debian/ unstable main contrib non-free

deb http://security.debian.org/ testing/updates main contrib non-free
deb-src http://security.debian.org/ testing/updates main contrib non-free
</code></pre><p>Now I need to tell Debian that I prefer the <em>testing</em> over <em>unstable</em> when
installing packages. To do this, create <code>/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/00local</code> and add
the following:</p>
<pre><code>APT::Default-Release &quot;testing&quot;;
</code></pre><p>Once done, proceed to <code>update</code>, <code>upgrade</code> and <code>dist-upgrade</code> with <code>apt-get</code> to
upgrade your system to <em>testing</em>.</p>
<p>During the upgrade you may see a prompt to install/upgrade package - this is
<code>apt-listbugs</code> doing its thing and showing bugs that could potentially cause problems.
It&rsquo;s a good idea to copy this text somewhere in case you need to reference it if
the worst does happen. Similarly, you may see a list of changelog entries after continuing. These are worth reading.</p>
<p>Once the upgrade process has completed, I installed XFCE4 and LightDM with
<code>apt-get install lightdm xfce4 xfce4-goodies</code>, then ran an <code>apt-get autoclean</code> to remove any
old packages and then rebooted the system.</p>
<p>At this point, I installed some bits and pieces I prefer, such as <code>postfix</code>,
<code>sudo</code> and <code>vim-nox</code>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/2014/02/my-debian-xfce4-tweaks/">next blog post</a> will detail the XFCE4 changes I made.</p>
